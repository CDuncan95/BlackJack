# BlackJack
BlackJack Game - Built as part of learncpp

Initial runthrough as a quick mockup all in a single file, and class-less.

Second iteration onwards splits this into multiple files for readability and introduces classes.

The master/main name change fucked me and git wouldn't let me merge them - ripme


TODO:
Add a mechanism to show the player their hand after each draw

Refactor the playBlackjack - I think I can make it slightly cleaner
