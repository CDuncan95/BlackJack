# BlackJack
BlackJack Game - Built as part of learncpp

Initial runthrough as a quick mockup all in a single file, and class-less.

The current iteration onwards splits this into multiple files for readability and introduces classes.

TODO:Add a mechanism to show the player their hand after each draw

TODO: Refactor the playBlackjack - I think I can make it slightly cleaner

TODO: Add a betting mechanism
